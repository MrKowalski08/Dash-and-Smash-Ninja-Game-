**Note**
This project was made for school half term and it learns me alot about programing in python and game development. 
I learnt new mechanics that appers in pygame and some tricks/tips how to optimize the game.
I was coping this code line by line and spent literally 1 month but it was worth it (i added some objects also).

I will remake this game in JavaScript in future :).
